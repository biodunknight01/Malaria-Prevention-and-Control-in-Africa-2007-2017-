# Malaria-Prevention-and-Control-in-Africa-2007-2017-
This analysis of malaria in Africa (2007-2017) highlights over 588 million cases, progress in prevention and treatment, and ongoing challenges in scaling interventions and improving infrastructure to accelerate elimination efforts.

Observation:
1. Total Malaria Cases
The total reported malaria cases across all African countries during the observed period is 588M.
Insight: The countries with the highest malaria burden include:
Congo, Dem. Rep. (78M cases)
Mozambique (44M cases)
Burkina Faso, Burundi, and Nigeria (~40M each).
2. Malaria Cases Reported by Year
A steady decline in malaria cases from 2008 (0.13bn) to 2017 (0.01bn).
The largest drop occurred between 2012 and 2014, suggesting increased effectiveness in malaria interventions during that time.
Insight: This trend reflects the impact of improved preventive measures like bed nets, IPT, and antimalarial drugs.
3. Access to Basic Sanitation Services
Countries with the highest sanitation service coverage include Mauritius (1036 people) and Egypt, Arab Rep. (999 people).
Other well-performing countries include Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco.
Insight: Improved sanitation correlates with reduced malaria incidence, as clean environments can decrease mosquito breeding sites.
4. Geographic Distribution of Malaria Incidence
High malaria incidence (per 1,000 population at risk) is seen in regions such as West and Central Africa.
Specific countries, such as those with incidence rates exceeding 35 per 1,000, highlight malaria hotspots.
Insight: These regions may need focused interventions, such as bed net distribution and environmental management.
5. Effectiveness of Preventive Measures
a. Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) for Pregnant Women
IPT adoption increased from 2008 (37%) to 2016 (588%), reflecting progress in maternal health programs.
b. Children with Fever Receiving Antimalarial Drugs
Countries like Liberia (304%) and Uganda (273%) report high coverage for children receiving antimalarial drugs.
Other countries like South Sudan and Mozambique lag behind.
Insight: Significant improvements in preventive care for pregnant women and children are visible, but some countries still need more targeted interventions.
6. Use of Basic Drinking Water Services
Countries like Egypt, Mauritius, and Tunisia have near-universal access to basic drinking water services.
Insight: There is a visible disparity between urbanized nations and rural or low-income regions, which impacts malaria control.
7. Preventive Measures for Under-5 Population
The average use of insecticide-treated bed nets among children under age 5 is 42.53% across observed countries.
Insight: This relatively low adoption rate could explain the persistence of malaria in certain regions.
8. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Average of Children with Fever Receiving Antimalarial Drugs: 30.20%
Indicates room for improvement in providing timely treatment to children with fever.
Count of Incidence of Malaria: 550 (possibly denoting unique incidents tracked).
Conclusion
The dashboard demonstrates positive trends in malaria reduction due to preventive measures. However, the data highlights disparities across countries, with certain regions needing enhanced focus on sanitation, drinking water access, and preventive interventions to sustain progress and achieve malaria eradication goals. Would you like recommendations for specific actions based on these insights?


Recommendations:
1. Strengthen and Scale Up Preventive Measures

Replace old and damaged nets regularly to maintain effectiveness.
Partner with NGOs and local governments to ensure ITN availability in the most remote areas.
Impact:
Reduces mosquito-human contact, significantly decreasing malaria transmission rates.
b. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS)
Action Plan:
Implement IRS campaigns in malaria hotspots, particularly in regions with high vector density.
Use long-lasting insecticides and monitor for resistance among mosquito populations.
Impact:
Kills mosquitoes that rest indoors, providing an additional layer of protection for households.
c. Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT)
Action Plan:
Expand IPT coverage to include all pregnant women and infants in high-transmission areas.
Train healthcare workers to promote IPT adherence during antenatal care visits.
Impact:
Prevents malaria during vulnerable periods, reducing maternal and infant mortality.
2. Improve Access to Treatment
a. Timely Diagnosis and Treatment
Action Plan:
Ensure every healthcare facility, including rural clinics, is equipped with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and effective antimalarial drugs.
Train health workers to provide accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatments.
Impact:
Reduces the severity of malaria cases and prevents fatalities.
b. Expand Access to Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies (ACTs)
Action Plan:
Subsidize ACTs to make them affordable and accessible to low-income populations.
Monitor for drug resistance and adapt treatment protocols as needed.
Impact:
Maintains treatment efficacy, reducing malaria mortality.
3. Invest in Water and Sanitation Infrastructure
